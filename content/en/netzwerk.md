## Bourdieu in the humanities

March 2021, a [workshop](https://networks.h-net.org/node/79435/discussions/6903020/cfp-bourdieu-der-germanistik), organised by **Karsten Schmidt** (University of Osnabrück) and myself took place, that for the first time brought together renowned researchers and young academics who work with the work of the French sociologist Bourdieu in German literature or linguistics. The workshop resulted in two key outcomes: an [open access anthology](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783110761122) published by **De Gruyter** and the establishment of an ongoing network of German-language Bourdieu research in the humanities.
