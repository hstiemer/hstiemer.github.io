From late February to early April 2024, I was a visiting researcher at the **Moore Institute** at the University of Galway (Ireland) through the **CLS INFRA Transnational Access Fellowship Programme**. During my stay, I engaged in intensive exchanges with colleagues from English and German literary studies as well as Digital Humanities, focusing on both modern studies and questions related to computational methods. My TNA talk was titled “Clash of the Modernists: Periodicals as an Object of Research in Literary Studies.” I discuss my stay in Galway in an [interview clip with CLS Infra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk0yODFSlDI). In summary, it was an exciting time in Galway that provided important insights for my research and interesting perspectives on another European academic system.
